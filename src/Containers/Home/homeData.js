      "At AssetMappr, I'm currently leading a three-member team in architecting and developing a community planning tool that enables seamless communication and informed decision-making. The project involves close collaboration with designers, community members, and faculty to curate and test feature enhancements for geospatial mapping, asset categorization, and data-driven insights. The aim is to empower effective decision making by developing a robust application with responsive desktop and mobile views using Django REST, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and TypeScript.",

      'At EXZEO India, one of my major projects was maintaining and enhancing Inbox, a web-based claim processing application. Deployed across eight insurance organizations, the project required following SCRUM agile methodology and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I led the UI development efforts, designing and implementing modular high-level and low-level UI components utilizing Vue.js and GraphQL. I also assembled a reusable package using JavaScript and Scalable Vector Graphics. This tool visualized the flow of claims across different workflows, enabling organizations to identify bottlenecks in their claim processing cycle.',

The application was built with Electron, React, and JavaScript, and featured an in-house spreadsheet and a cloud-based file management system to store onsite information. Additionally, a multi-threaded service using resizing algorithms was architected to reduce image processing time by 99%.',
